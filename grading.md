## ## Lee-Ann Seegets (17.5/20P)

### Implementing the $1 Gesture Recognizer (4/4P)
* $1 gesture recognizer works and is efficiently implemented
    * yep (2P)
* Five gestures can be distinguished
    * yep (1P)
* Gesture entry user interface
    * yep (1P)


### Mid-Air Gestures with $1 Recognizer (5/6P)
* Pose detection works reliably and with low latency
    * doesn't work reliably (-0.5P)
* Mapping of landmarks to a pointer position works
    * pointer movement could have been only in the recognizer window, not the whole desktop(s) (-0.5P)
* Application controls the mouse pointer
    * yep (2P)
* Mid-air gesture interaction is integrated into $1 recognizer
    * yep (1P)
* Recording works and recorded ata is stored appropriately
    * yep (1P)

### Comparing Gesture Recognizers (5/5P)
* Both datasets have the same format and dimension, they are loaded correctly
    * yep (1P)
* LSTM gesture classifier works and is trained on Wobbrock et al.â€™s gesture logs
    * yep (1P)
* Systematical comparison of different parameter counts and the $1 recognizer
    * yep (1P)
* Proper visualization and description of results
    * yep (1P)
* Conclusive reasoning when comparing the LSTM vs. $1 and touchpad/mouse input vs. mid-air input
    * yep (1P)
* Correct evaluation and description with significance tests
    * no bonus point

### Gesture Detection Game (3.5/5P)
* Gesture input works with touchpad/mouse and mid-air
    * yep (1P)
* Functionality and aesthetics of the application
    * round-based schere-stein-papier is questionable, turn it into a strategy game or some information like "player 1, pls close your eyes" (-0.5P)
    * really basic aesthetics (0P)
* Three gestures are distinguished robustly
    * yep (2P)
